# Stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Objective
The purpose of our analysis was to help a client, Steve, make informed decisions about which green energy company (out of a set of 12) would be the best investment. In order to do so, we use Visual Basic to build macros which will calculate the total daily volume, and percent return, based upon aggregate data of the 12 different green energy companies ([the data set to be used can be found here](Resources/VBA_Challenge.xlsm)). We format the information so Steve is left with a tool which is simple to use and easy to interpret. 

Further, we provide two versions of the VBA macros, one which simply gets the job done, and another which has been optimized for speed. This way, if Steve needs to apply the method we've provided him to extremely large sets of data in the future, he has a means of reducing the time it takes to run the analysis. 

### Background Information

As mentioned above, we will calculate two parameters in order to analyze the stock performances of the 12 companies:

1. __Total Daily Volume__  
The total daily volume refers to the sum of all the stocks that were traded that day. It can indicate the health of a stock, as higher volumes indicate more interest in that particular company ([read more here](https://www.investorsunderground.com/stock-volume/)) In our analysis, we find total daily volume by simply adding all the volume amounts for a given company.

2. __Percent Return__  
The percent return of a stock indicates net growth or net loss of a stock over a given time period ([read more here](https://finance.zacks.com/stock-market-returns-work-6598.html)). It is valuable in assesing the likelyhood that an investment in a company will yield profit. Here, we find the return by looking at the percent difference between the open value on the first date, and the close value of the last date.
