# Stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of our analysis was to help a client, Steve, make informed decisions about which green energy company (out of a set of 12) would be the best investment. In order to do so, we use Visual Basic to build macros which will calculate the total daily volume, and percent return, based upon aggregate data of the 12 different green energy companies. We format the information so Steve is left with a tool which is simple to use and easy to interpret. Further, we provide two versions of the VBA macros, one which simply gets the job done, and another which has been optimized for speed. This way, if Steve needs to apply the method we've provided him to extremely large sets of data in the future, he has a means of reducing the time it takes to run the analysis.
